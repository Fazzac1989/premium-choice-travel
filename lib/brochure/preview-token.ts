/**
 * A short-lived pass for the staff preview of a proposal.
 *
 * `/proposals/<id>` is guarded because brochure ids are sequential and the
 * prices behind them are not public. But the admin that links to it lives on
 * another domain, so its session cookie never arrives here — the preview
 * bounced to the login screen and back to the menu.
 *
 * A signed token solves both: it proves the link came from the admin, and it
 * expires, so a copied preview URL is not a permanent back door.
 *
 * The signing key is derived from the service-role key rather than being a new
 * secret to configure, because both apps already hold that one and a second
 * environment variable that must match in two places is a thing to get wrong.
 * It is derived, not used directly, so the token can never leak the key.
 *
 * This file is mirrored in the School Trips app, which verifies what this one
 * signs. Both copies must agree.
